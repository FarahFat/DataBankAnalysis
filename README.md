## DataBankAnalysis
The project "SQL Portfolio Project - Data Bank" focuses on exploring a hypothetical digital bank's data to derive insights and aid in decision-making. The project is structured into several key sections, each addressing different analytical challenges: 

Customer Nodes Exploration: Queries in this section analyze the distribution of customers across various regions and nodes, examining aspects like the number of unique nodes, node distribution per region, customer allocation per region, and the average days of customer reallocation.

Customer Transactions: This segment focuses on transactional data, including the unique count and total amount per transaction type, average historical deposits, and customer behaviors like the frequency of deposits and withdrawals.

Data Allocation Challenge: Involving more complex scenarios, this part tests hypotheses about data allocation based on customer balances, exploring different methods of data allocation and their impacts.


The project combines data manipulation, aggregation, and complex calculations to provide comprehensive insights into customer behavior, transaction patterns, and hypothetical data allocation strategies for the bank. Each section not only solves specific business questions but also demonstrates advanced SQL skills.
